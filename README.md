# Ranker

## Ranker program
This program allows users to rank a list of things of their choosing from best to worst. It asks the users the minimum number of required questions in order to gauge the exact position a new element should be placed in the list. 

It includes the ability to save the user's progress by writing their ranking list to a file and allows the users to undo their selections as far back as they want.
